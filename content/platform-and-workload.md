# Multi-region platform and multi-region workload

A **multi-region platform** and a **multi-region workload** operate at different layers. The platform creates governed regional choices for the customer estate; the workload applies one or more of those choices to a specific workload. Keeping these concepts separate prevents multi-region strategy from being treated as an automatic requirement for a new landing zone, workload migration, active-active high availability, or active/passive disaster recovery.

## The city analogy

Think of the platform as a city, and workloads as the people and businesses that live in it. The city builds neighborhoods, services, roads, transit, and laws once. A family settles in one neighborhood; a bank spreads across several. Neither builds a new city.

:::image type="content" source="./media/city-analogy.png" alt-text="Isometric city used as an analogy for a multi-region platform. An office campus outside the city connects to Downtown through express toll lanes with two interchanges. Downtown has every service locally. Riverside has a fire station and a clinic. Hillcrest and Midtown have homes only and reach Downtown's services by transit. Lakeside is an off-grid island with no roads or transit. A new plot is zoned but not yet built. Numbered pins mark where four families live, and bank badges mark two branches and a backup operations center." lightbox="./media/city-analogy.png":::

      **The household: a single-region workload**

      Most workloads live in one neighborhood: the one that fits how they live.

      1. **Works fully remote and is self-sufficient** (self-contained) picks Lakeside; off-grid is fine.
      2. **Works remote but relies on city services** (selectively connected) picks Midtown, one transit ride from the hospital.
      3. **Commutes to the office every day** (hybrid-dependent) picks Hillcrest, for transit plus the express lanes.
      4. **Extended family, always visiting** (interdependent groups) picks Riverside, with local services for a close-knit group.

      **The bank: a multi-region workload**

      Some workloads need several neighborhoods, for reach and for resilience.

      - **Headquarters and core systems** stay on the office campus: on-premises.
      - **Express lanes through two interchanges**, so one can close: ExpressRoute with circuit diversity.
      - **Branches in Riverside and Midtown** serve customers together: active-active.
      - **A backup operations center in Hillcrest** stands by: active/passive recovery.
      - **Banking licenses and secure vaults** on top of city law: compliance and specialized SKUs.

| In the city | In Azure |
|---|---|
| Neighborhoods | Azure regions |
| Transit between neighborhoods | Connectivity between regions |
| Express toll lanes | ExpressRoute |
| Office campus outside the city | On-premises |
| Police, fire, hospitals, utilities | Shared services |
| Laws, codes, zoning | Governance and policy |

## Platform and workload layers

:::image type="content" source="./media/platform-and-workload-layers.png" alt-text="Diagram contrasting the multi-region platform, which creates governed regional choices through governance, identity and security, monitoring, connectivity patterns, deployment automation, and quota planning, with the multi-region workload, which selects qualified regions for net-new placement, relocation, active/passive recovery, active-active distribution, or continued single-region operation." lightbox="./media/platform-and-workload-layers.png":::

| | Multi-region platform | Multi-region workload |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Enable placement flexibility across qualified Azure regions | Meet workload-specific objectives and requirements such as availability, disaster recovery, user proximity, or regulatory requirements |
| **Focus** | Regional readiness and consistency of shared platform capabilities | Application architecture, data, dependencies, traffic, availability, and recovery |
| **Design driven by** | The needs of the portfolio of workloads the platform is expected to support | The specific workload's requirements, such as availability, resiliency, RTO/RPO, latency, or data requirements |
| **Outcome** | Additional regions qualified through the existing landing-zone operating model, approved connectivity patterns, deployment automation, and quota planning | Net-new placement in another region, selective relocation, active/passive recovery, active-active distribution, or continued operation in one region |

Reuse the existing Azure landing-zone operating model by default. Extend regional policy parameters, connectivity, shared services, automation, and operations only where documented workload requirements justify them. A multi-region platform doesn't require a separate connectivity landing zone or identical shared services in every region; workload requirements determine the cross-region design.
