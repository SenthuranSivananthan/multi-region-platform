# Multi-region platform strategy

Adding an Azure region shouldn't mean starting another landing-zone project. If you already run Azure landing zones, most of what a new region needs already exists: the governance, identity, policy, automation, and operating model.

## What adding a region involves

A new region is often assumed to be a large project. With this approach, it is a short series of decisions and a targeted change to the platform you already run.

| Common assumption | With this approach |
|---|---|
| A new region needs its own landing-zone design. | Reuse the existing landing zone. The region is added to the policies, automation, and monitoring you already run. See [Framework overview](./framework-overview.md#principles-and-constructs). |
| Every region needs a full hub. | Start with the most efficient [Platform Services profile](./platform-services-profiles.md) that meets the requirements. Two of the four profiles need no local hub. |
| Every region needs another ExpressRoute circuit. | Reuse existing hybrid connectivity where reachability and resiliency requirements allow. Add circuits only when a requirement justifies them. See [Confirm hybrid connectivity](./hybrid-connectivity.md). |
| Enabling a region means migrating workloads. | Nothing has to move. Workloads use the region when their own requirements call for it. See [Place workloads](./workload-placement.md). |
| Qualification is a long assessment. | It is four checks, each with one question, answered from what your teams already know. Unknowns are recorded and revisited, not treated as blockers. See [Regional qualification](./regional-qualification.md). |

The first additional region takes the most thought, because the decisions are made for the first time. Later regions reuse those decisions and become mostly configuration. For more examples, see [Common misconceptions](./misconceptions.md).

## How it works

The framework has five parts. Each part answers one question.

1. **[Understand concepts](./platform-and-workload.md).** What is a multi-region platform, what can a region provide, and what do applications need? Four [Platform Services profiles](./platform-services-profiles.md) describe the platform options. Four [Workload Landing Zone archetypes](./workload-landing-zone-archetypes.md) describe what applications require.
1. **[Qualify regions](./regional-qualification.md).** Can this region support the workloads we expect? Four checks lead to one of four outcomes: excluded, candidate, conditional, or qualified.
1. **[Select the regional design](./platform-architecture.md).** What should the platform provide in a qualified region? Make three choices from short lists: the Platform Services profile, where each shared service is provided, and whether the hybrid connectivity you already have is reused. The region is then **selected**.
1. **[Prepare the region](./prepare-region.md).** What has to exist before workloads arrive? Build only what the selected design calls for, through the automation you already run. Two of the four profiles need no hub. The region is then **ready for workloads**.
1. **[Place workloads](./workload-placement.md).** Should this workload use the region now? Decide per workload, with current evidence. The region is then **in use**.

## From a fixed pair to governed options

*From a fixed regional pair to governed regional options. Instead of mirroring a complete footprint in each new region, extend one governed foundation. Platform Services span Security, Identity, Management, and Networking; each region provides only the local capabilities its workloads require.*
