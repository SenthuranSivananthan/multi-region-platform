# Get started with a multi-region platform

Use this sequence to establish the first additional regional options. Start with one candidate region and the workloads that need it. The same process scales to a broader portfolio, and later regions reuse the decisions made for the first.

1. **Name the drivers.** Identify what is prompting the discussion: business growth, regulation, service or SKU availability, resiliency, a datacenter or connectivity event, cost, or another measurable requirement. See [common drivers](./framework-overview.md#common-drivers-of-multi-region-platform-discussions).
1. **Understand the concepts.** Learn how a [multi-region platform differs from a multi-region workload](./platform-and-workload.md), the four [Platform Services profiles](./platform-services-profiles.md) a region can provide, and the four [Workload Landing Zone archetypes](./workload-landing-zone-archetypes.md) that describe what applications need. You make no decisions here. You learn the terms the next steps use.
1. **Shortlist and qualify candidate regions.** Work through the four [qualification checks](./regional-qualification.md). Start with the two that need no technical assessment, [business and geography](./business-and-geography.md) and [data and compliance](./data-and-compliance.md), and remove regions that cannot satisfy mandatory conditions. For the regions that remain, identify [workload requirements and dependencies](./workload-requirements.md), then validate [regional capability and availability](./regional-capability.md). Record each option as excluded, candidate, conditional, or qualified for the defined requirements, with evidence and revalidation triggers. See [Assessment outcome](./regional-qualification.md#assessment-outcome).
1. **Select the regional design.** For each qualified region, select the most efficient [Platform Services profile](./profile-selection.md#which-platform-services-profile-should-this-region-provide) that meets the requirements, decide [where each shared service is provided](./platform-enablement-connectivity.md), and confirm whether the [hybrid connectivity](./hybrid-connectivity.md) you already have is enough. Write the three choices into the [regional design record](./platform-architecture.md#the-regional-design-record), and agree who owns each decision.
1. **Prepare the region.** Build what the record says, through the automation you already run. Read only the page for the profile you selected: [No platform](./disconnected-spokes.md), [Remote platform](./remote-hub.md), [Minimal platform](./minimal-regional-hub.md), or [Full platform](./full-regional-hub.md). Use the [platform readiness checklist](./platform-readiness.md) to confirm the region is ready before the first workload arrives.
1. **Place the first workload.** Apply the [workload-placement process](./workload-placement.md) using current evidence. Revalidate regional capabilities at decision time, govern the placement and resiliency decisions, and feed newly discovered requirements or platform gaps back into regional qualification.

> [!TIP]
> **What success looks like:** Being able to qualify a regional option, enable only the platform capabilities it requires, and onboard workloads through a repeatable governed process.
