# Select the Platform Services profile

**Question:** What is the most efficient regional platform design that supports the identified requirements?

Determine how workloads in the region will reach Full-Platform regions, shared platform services, application dependencies, other Azure regions, and hybrid environments. Those connectivity and dependency requirements determine which [Platform Services profile](./platform-services-profiles.md) fits: No platform, Remote platform, Minimal platform, or Full platform.

Start with the matrix to see which Platform Services profiles each [archetype](./workload-landing-zone-archetypes.md) typically uses. Then apply the selection principles and use the decision tree to pick the most efficient profile that meets the requirements.

:::image type="content" source="./media/archetype-profile-matrix.png" alt-text="Matrix of the four archetypes against the four Platform Services profiles. Self-Contained Workloads often use No platform and other profiles where justified; Selectively Connected Workloads can use No platform where approved local peering or Azure service endpoints suffice, or Remote platform, Minimal platform, or Full platform; Hybrid-Dependent Workloads use Remote platform, Minimal platform, or Full platform; interdependent groups can use No platform for approved same-region connectivity, Remote platform where acceptable, and Minimal platform or Full platform when justified." lightbox="./media/archetype-profile-matrix.png":::

*Archetype-to-profile relationships are many-to-many. Each row is a set of options, not an assignment; the selected profile follows dependencies, latency, traffic, resiliency, and independence requirements.*

| Archetype | No platform | Remote platform | Minimal platform | Full platform |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-Contained Workloads | Often | Where justified | Where justified | Where justified |
| Selectively Connected Workloads | Where hub-free | Typical | Typical | Typical |
| Hybrid-Dependent Workloads | Not indicated | Typical | Typical | Typical |
| Interdependent Workload Groups | Approved same-region connectivity | Where acceptable | When justified | When justified |

No platform can still provide approved direct same-region spoke connectivity and private endpoints for Azure services. These paths must satisfy DNS, security, inspection, and operational requirements without a network hub or gateway for hybrid connectivity. A private endpoint alone does not require Remote platform, Minimal platform, or Full platform.

## Profile selection principles

- Start with the **workload requirements and dependencies** identified during regional qualification, including portfolio-level dependencies. Use Workload Landing Zone archetypes to spot recurring needs, then validate the profile against the actual workloads.
- Select the **most efficient profile** that satisfies those requirements, not the maximum possible one.
- Keep capabilities remote when latency, dependency, data, security, resiliency, availability, and operational requirements permit. Add local capabilities only when a measurable requirement justifies the larger regional footprint; adoption growth alone doesn't.
- Consider direct spoke-to-spoke connectivity where workloads have significant east-west traffic and a network hub transit path is unnecessary. Add regional routing, inspection, or shared services when broader requirements justify them.

## Which Platform Services profile should this region provide?

Each question comes from the "fits when" criteria of the [Platform Services profiles](./platform-services-profiles.md). Stop at the first profile that satisfies the requirements identified in [check 3](./workload-requirements.md#platform-and-connectivity-requirements).

:::image type="content" source="./media/platform-services-profile-decision-tree.png" alt-text="Decision tree with three questions. If approved same-region spoke connectivity and Azure service endpoints meet all requirements without hub or on-premises access, use No platform. If they can tolerate the latency and coupling of another region, use Remote platform. If requirements do not justify a comprehensive local capability set, use a Minimal platform; otherwise use a Full platform." lightbox="./media/platform-services-profile-decision-tree.png":::

*Platform Services profile selection tree. Questions escalate from dependency, to tolerance of remote consumption, to required independence. The outcome is a platform capability, not a workload design.*

The same tree as a table, from the smallest regional footprint to the largest:

| Profile | Fits when the workloads expected in the region | What the region gets |
|---|---|---|
| [No platform](./disconnected-spokes.md) | Need no Full-Platform region, on-premises path, centralized inspection, or private network connectivity beyond approved same-region spokes and Azure service endpoints. | No network hub and no gateway, only platform services that are Global. Workload spokes use the estate's standard identity, policy, security, and deployment practices. |
| [Remote platform](./remote-hub.md) | Need Full-Platform region capabilities or wider private network access, and can tolerate the latency, availability coupling, and dependency on connectivity to another region. | No local network hub. Workload spokes consume services from another existing Full-Platform region. |
| [Minimal platform](./minimal-regional-hub.md) | Need some capabilities locally, without a comprehensive local set. | A local network hub and only other platform services that must be in the region. Everything else stays remote. |
| [Full platform](./full-regional-hub.md) | Need a comprehensive local capability set of platform services, and independence from other regions. | The complete local connectivity and shared services that the region's workloads require. |

Two of the four profiles need no local network hub, and only the Full platform approaches the footprint of an existing Full-Platform region.

**Decision:** Select the most efficient Platform Services profile that satisfies the identified requirements and can evolve as regional adoption changes.

## Considerations and reassessment by profile

Check these points before you settle on a profile, and revisit the profile when its reassessment trigger applies. Profiles can move in both directions.

### No platform

**Key considerations:** Validate administration, identity, DNS, secrets, telemetry, data movement, software distribution, private endpoints, incident response, and support procedures. Where applications require east-west communication within the region, evaluate direct spoke-to-spoke connectivity without assuming that a local network hub is required. Confirm that no hidden dependency requires connectivity to a Full-Platform region or on-premises environment.

**Reassess when:** Workloads require a Full-Platform region, on-premises connectivity, centralized inspection, or private network paths beyond approved same-region spokes and Azure service endpoints.

### Remote platform

**Key considerations:** Measure latency and bandwidth using representative traffic. Evaluate cross-region data-transfer cost, routing and transit behavior, inspection paths, Full-Platform region scale, dependency criticality, and operational ownership. Document how workloads behave if the Full-Platform region or cross-region connectivity is degraded or unavailable.

**Reassess when:** Cross-region traffic, latency, east-west communication, dependency criticality, regulatory requirements, scale, or availability coupling justify deploying selected connectivity or shared-service capabilities locally.

### Minimal platform

**Key considerations:** Clearly define which capabilities operate locally and which remain remote. Avoid ambiguous routing, overlapping responsibilities, and unnecessary duplication of platform controls. Validate workload and operational behavior when either local capabilities or remote dependencies are unavailable. When connectivity to on-premises environments is required, determine whether existing ExpressRoute circuits and gateway topology can provide the required reachability before introducing additional circuits; do not assume that each Azure region requires a dedicated ExpressRoute circuit.

**Reassess when:** Workload growth introduces additional local connectivity or shared-service requirements, multiple Interdependent Workload Groups require broader regional capabilities, stricter independence requirements emerge, significant hybrid connectivity is required locally, or other requirements justify expanding the regional platform footprint.

### Full platform

**Key considerations:** Confirm that the required level of independence justifies the additional cost and operational scope. Validate automation, observability, support ownership, security operations, configuration consistency, dependency behavior, and lifecycle management. Where on-premises connectivity is required, determine whether existing ExpressRoute circuits can provide the required reachability and resiliency before introducing additional connectivity.

**Reassess when:** Workload demand or requirements decrease, services can be safely centralized, dependencies change, or the full regional footprint no longer provides sufficient value relative to its cost and operational complexity.

## What each step up costs

Greater local capability and independence usually increase fixed platform cost and operational scope, but they can reduce cross-region dependencies, latency exposure, and availability coupling.
