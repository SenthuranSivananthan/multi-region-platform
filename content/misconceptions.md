# Common multi-region misconceptions

Multi-region programs often become more complex than necessary when teams start from assumptions instead of workload and platform requirements. The corrections cover qualification, platform capabilities and connectivity, workload placement, service guides, and Resources.

| Misconception | Correction |
|---|---|
| "Adding a region means another landing-zone project, with its own governance model." | The landing zone you already run is reused: governance, identity, policy, automation, and the operating model stay the same. A new region adds regional configuration and only the Platform Services profile its workloads need. See [Framework overview](./framework-overview.md#principles-and-constructs) and the [Platform readiness checklist](./platform-readiness.md). |
| "We must choose the perfect regions up front." | Regional requirements and Azure capabilities change. Design the platform so additional qualified options can be introduced without redesigning the broader operating model. See [Regional qualification](./regional-qualification.md). |
| "Qualified means approved for any workload." | Qualification is scoped to defined requirements and evidence at a point in time. Each workload revalidates regional suitability during onboarding. See [Assessment outcome](./regional-qualification.md#assessment-outcome). |
| "Every new region needs a Full platform." | Select the most efficient profile that satisfies the identified requirements. Profiles are not maturity stages; any profile can remain the long-term target while it continues to meet those requirements. See [Platform Services profiles](./platform-services-profiles.md). |
| "Another Azure region requires another ExpressRoute circuit." | An additional region does not by itself require another circuit. Additional hybrid connectivity should be introduced where reachability, diversity, failure-domain, latency, routing, or bandwidth requirements justify it. See [Confirm hybrid connectivity](./hybrid-connectivity.md). |
| "Enabling a region means migrating workloads." | Regional qualification and platform readiness are not workload placement. Remaining in the existing region can be the appropriate outcome. See [Place workloads](./workload-placement.md). |
| "A paired region is our disaster recovery." | Region pairing supports specific Azure platform and service behaviors; it does not automatically provide workload recovery. Recovery must still be designed and validated per workload. See [Paired and nonpaired regions](./paired-nonpaired-regions.md). |
| "A multi-region platform means active-active." | The platform creates regional options. Whether a workload is single-region, primary/recovery, or active across regions is a separate workload-specific resiliency decision. See [Service Guides for Multi Region](./workload-design.md). |
